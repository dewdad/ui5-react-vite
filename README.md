## Features Roadmap

- [ ] Navigation Routing
  
  - [ ] Route as single source of truth => state by route/url-query (for sorting, filtering, etc.), avoid React state whenever possible
    
    - [With React-Router](https://ui.dev/react-router-query-strings)
      - Why you should lift component state up to the URL <https://youtu.be/sFTGEs2WXQ4>
    - [With useQueryParams hook](https://github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params)
    - [atomWithHash from "jotai/utils" package](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-and-why-you-should-store-react-ui-state-in-the-url-f2013a204cb2#694f)
    - With React-Location
      - [Blog series](https://omarelhawary.me/blog/file-based-routing-with-react-location-data-loaders) about file-based routing for React with React-location
      - <https://react-location.tanstack.com/>
  
  - [ ] File based routing with [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) (auto-generated)

  - [ ] Enable Launchpad Service integration by supporting semantic objects + pre-filling of fields when navigating

- [ ] Linting _**need to complete porting from CRA, fix remaining errs_

- [ ] Pre-commit sanity, rename to .husky folder in root after fixing linting issues, and remove ## symbols from package.json props
